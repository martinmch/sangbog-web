This project is a wrapper around hugo and pandoc to generate a songbook website.
The goal is generate a website and eventually pdf collections of songs.
A very cool feature could be to be able to select multiple songs or authors, and
generate song books directly. With and without chords.



## Goals

[] Write software that generates hugo files from chordpro directory
    parser :: file -> chordProFile
    formatter :: chordProFile -> markdown


# ChordPro File

A jumble of lines.
